This code snippet demonstrates the following techniques to improve the accuracy of the virtual clothes try-on method:

Pose Estimation: The code uses a pre-trained pose estimation model to estimate the keypoints of the user's body. This helps to accurately align the virtual clothing with the user's body.
Clothing Segmentation: The code uses a pre-trained clothing segmentation model to segment the clothing from the input image. This helps to accurately combine the virtual clothing with the original image.
Image Warping: The code uses image warping to transform the virtual clothing image to match the user's pose. This helps to create a more realistic and accurate try-on experience.
Masking: The code uses masking to combine the warped virtual clothing image with the original image. This helps to accurately blend the virtual clothing with the original image.
Note that this is just a sample code snippet, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific use case. Additionally, you may need to fine-tune the pre-trained models and adjust the hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
